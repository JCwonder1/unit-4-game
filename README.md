# unit-4-game
JavaScript RPG.  Choose a character.  Fight other characters.  Win when you defeat them all.  

Technical Challenges:  Figuring out how the game would keep track of plays choosen, enemies and when there were not more enemies to defeat.  I used an array to solve this and evertime a player was choosen or defeated I would remove that player from the array.  Once the array was empty the game would be over.  Another challenge was not letting the user choose another enemy when they were in battle with an enemy.  I had to check for this everytime the user choose and enemy.
